### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing double majors in CS/OR. I have a diverse set of passions but am primarily interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning! You can read more about some of my recent projects here on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/adversarially-trained-classifiers-for-generalizable-real-world-applications-92dbcb24f7f3)

This semester, I'm taking graduate level CS/OR courses on Financial Engineering, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and Statistical Learning

I am currently working on a new start-up project on Edtech. Most recently, I worked in Fall 2020 with [AnChain.AI](https://www.anchain.ai/) on AI Security for Blockchain

You can each me at shichuchen0114 [at] berkeley [dot] edu. I'm always open to working on new projects :)
