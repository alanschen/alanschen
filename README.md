### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Hey! I'm a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing double majors in CS/OR. I have a diverse set of passions but am primarily interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning! You can read more about my projects here on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/adversarially-trained-classifiers-for-generalizable-real-world-applications-92dbcb24f7f3)

This semester, I'm taking graduate level OR courses on Financial Engineering as well as Learning and Optimization.

I am currently working on a new start-up project on Edtech! Most recently, I worked last semester (Fall 2020) with [AnChain.AI](https://www.anchain.ai/) on AI Security for Blockchain.

You can each me at shichuchen0114[at]berkeley[dot]edu! I'm always open to working on new projects :)
