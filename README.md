## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a currently a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing double majors in CS/ORMS. I have a diverse set of interests, but am primarily interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning. You can read more about some of my recent projects on [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/@shichuchen0114)

I worked in Fall 2020 with [AnChain.AI](https://www.anchain.ai/) on AI Security for Blockchain
