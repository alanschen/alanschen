### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Hey! I'm a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing double majors in CS/OR. I have a diverse set of passions but am primarily interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning! This semester, I'm taking graduate level OR courses on Financial Engineering, Control, and Optimization

I am currently working on a new start-up project on Edtech! Most recently, I worked last semester (Fall 2020) with [AnChain.AI](https://www.anchain.ai/) on AI Security for Blockchain.

You can each me at shichuchen0114[at]berkeley[dot]edu! I'm always open to working on new projects :)
